# Smartlock with Integrated Advanced Recognition
This is a project that secure and safeguard the premises. This project use Artificial Intelligence(AI) technique such as Deep Learning(DL) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization.

# Sample Result
<br>Result with MatLab:

<br>Result using MatLab: The MatLab developed with this Interface is for Proof of Concept (POC) and does not mean to be used in the real implementation. The real implementation would be embeded inside Raspberry PI 4 or Nano Jetson.
