# Smartlock with Integrated Advanced Recognition
This is a project that secure and safeguard the premises. This project use Artificial Intelligence(AI) technique such as Deep Learning(DL) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN).

The project is developed by following Project Management Plan(PMP) to better organized the lifecycle of the project. Several charting techniques such as Gantt Chart, Milestone Chart, Work Breakdown Structure(WBS) is used to manage the project.

The PMP-Plan developed is simply a simulation collaboration between third party organization.
