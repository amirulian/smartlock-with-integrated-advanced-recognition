# Project Summary
VC Jewelry Goldsmith is a company that offers expensive and high-quality jewelry such as earrings, rings, and chains. They also sell gold. Due to the high-value products they sell, VC Jewelry Goldsmith is upgrading their security system to secure its place.

Smart locks with the advanced integrated system will be used to lock each shop lot door including the inside and outside doors.
