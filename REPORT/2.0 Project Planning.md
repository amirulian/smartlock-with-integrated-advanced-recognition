# Project Planning
The project management life cycle is depicted and documented in the form of a Gantt Chart, which allows HanSen personnel to adhere to the rules and meet milestones on a regular basis. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's role and work, such as the project manager, into many modules. Based on the WBS, each member has their own duties and responsibilities at each point of the lifecycle.

## Project Management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:
