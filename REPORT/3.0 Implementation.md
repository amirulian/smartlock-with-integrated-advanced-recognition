# Deliverables:
Software Requirements: 
1.	A **Linux-Based Operating System** to deploy and operate facial and fingerprint recognition algorithms.
2.	A **User-Interface Application** allow user to interact with the smart lock using devices.

# Hardware Requirements: 
1.	A **Camera** to capture facial images of users and used in identifying faces.
2.	**Fingerprint Scanner** to recognize and authenticate userâ€™s fingerprint.
3.	A **Raspberry Pi** as the microcontroller to capture data and communicate with devices.
4.	**Display Screen** to navigating user and displaying messages.

# Intelligence System Architectures:
One potential neural network architecture for a smart lock with facial and fingerprint recognition is a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are well-suited for image-based tasks such as facial recognition because they can extract useful features from the raw data and classify them based on patterns and structures present in the images.
